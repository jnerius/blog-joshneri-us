Another Thanksgiving break, another blog migration. 

# Why? 

One word: _maintenance_. 

Each time I move the blog, it's usually because I read some article or ShowHN post about the latest and greatest thing. I get curious, decide to try it, decide I like it, decide to move my blog to it. And then, I forget how to maintain it. 

The holiday break ends, and invariably I end up too busy to write. Too busy to write means too busy to spend any time with the blog, and by the time I get back to it months later, I'm so many versions behind, and it'd take me forever to figure out how to catch up. 

# You don't write anyway, why bother? 

I'm always surprised at the steady stream of traffic a few specific blog posts get. Because of this, I try to make sure things stay up and running, and the simpler it is to do that, the better. 

### Note

I have no affiliation with Netlify. I am not endorsing them, and they are not paying me to mention them. They just happen to be one of the easier ways to get up and running with Hugo without the overhead/cost of running a VM somewhere and without the limitations imposed by GitHub pages.
